                <p style = "font-family: sans-serif;">
                    I am an intermediate level pianist and I have some silly little compositions that I have put together over the past.
                    I have done some compositions for an escape room I used to work at, they didn't fit in quite right so they were never implemented.
                    However, the songs exist all the same.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Music has been a part of my life for some time. As a child I always wanted to have an instrument, at the time it was drums.
                    At some point in high school I finally got a piano. My dad got it for free from a friend and gave it to me.
                    I didn't practice as much as I wish I had. I eventually started playing more as I got into college. 
                    I took classes to become better and I have been progressing steadily since.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Below is a list of several samples of the type of original music I have made. 
                    My piano is put away right now so these are just some pieces I had laying on my computer.
