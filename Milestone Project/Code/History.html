            <h2>History of Nate</h2>
            <h3>A brief overview</h3>
            <p>
                The story of Nate starts in an older mining town off of the Historic Route 66, Kingman, Arizona.
                This is where I was born and lived the first half of my life.
                I grew up a bit of a desert rat just being a kid and not having a care in the world.
                Looking back on it, and after I have some conversations with my sister and old friends, the more I realize we were less like kids and more like wild animals.
                Some of us turned out pretty alright given the conditions we were raised in, others.... 
                I pray that they find their peace with God before their time comes.
                <br/><br/>
                Fat forward a few years and I move to California, suffer undiagnosed depression and turn to a life of video games.
                I really spend a lot of time in video games.
                <br/><br/>
                Really, it was a lot of video games.
                <br/><br/>
                I played so many video games that I wanted to drown out life around me and never made any friends.
                This spree of games caused me to start to fail in the middle of high school. That continued on until I had to go to a continuation school for delinquents.
                At some point I had earned the nickname Neo, from the matrix, and the thugs had accepted me as cool enough not to bother.
                I graduated, to my own surprise, but then the games continued as I took community college classes.
