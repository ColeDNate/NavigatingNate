                <h2>The Engine is the Heart of the Machine</h2>
                <p style = "font-family: sans-serif;">
                    As a motorcyclist in full gear, I am an entirely different person. At least, that is what the general population thinks.
                    When I walk around town off of my machine when I have my helmet and gear, I am never greeted with warmth. 
                    It is a vastly different experience compared to when I take my car.
                    This is important to understand because it is important to ignore.
                    My identity is not made up of the opinions of others who. The bike is only a fraction of who I am.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I ride to hone my skills. I ride to feel life outside of a box. I ride to save money on gas. Seriously, gas is super expensive in California.
                    When I am not riding, I make sure to take care of my machine.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I am a mechanic. I manage my motorcycle and my car. If I fail to take care of my machines they will leave me stranded some place I would rather not be.
                    The title of the page, the heart of the machine, is not about what I like or what I am interested.
                    It is about who I am. I endeavor to understand the mechanics of everything around me.
                    The engine is the metaphor. I understand the engine so that I can understand myself.
